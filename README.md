//CLIENT

server.js:
    -   The code imports the axios library.
    -   It creates a new Axios instance configured with http://localhost:8000 as the base URL.
    -   It then exports this instance as the default export of the module, so it can be easily imported and used in other parts of the application for making HTTP requests to the specified base URL.



//Server

generate.js:
     generates the private key
